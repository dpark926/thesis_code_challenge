## Thank You!

- This site was built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
  - Provides server side rendering
  - Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
  - Simple client-side routing (page based)
  - Hot Module Replacement baked in
- Used the [Frontend Checklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/) as reference and I did my best to optimize the website.
- I use [Basscss](http://basscss.com/) for this project and also on a normal basis but I realized that this may be confusing and loathsome for many as the styling exists in multiple locations. I personally like it and it improves my workflow but I may want move away from it as I don't think that it'll be prominent in industry. If `className="absolute"` irks you, then I apologize.
- I'm using CDN's to import the font and the Basscss library. I'm not quite sure if having these locally would improve the performance.
